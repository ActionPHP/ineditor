ineditor
========

Simple inline editor jQuery plugin.

Usage:

Simply append .ineditor() to your element by class or ID.

Example: $('.edit-this').ineditor();

Keep in mind that this version changes the value, without senind it back to you.
At the moment I use it with Backbone.js so when the model is changed an event is triggered.
